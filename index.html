<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: 05 February 2026</p>

<p>
Reqtor ("the App") is a developer utility application designed to help developers and testers
create, execute, and validate HTTP API requests and collections of requests.
This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled when you use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
Reqtor does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any user data to servers owned or controlled by the developer</strong>.
</p>
<p>
All API-related data entered by the user, including API endpoints (URLs), headers, request bodies,
parameters, test configurations, and API responses, is user-provided and is used solely for
executing API requests and validating responses within the App.
</p>

<h2>2. How the App Processes Data</h2>
<p>
Reqtor functions as a client-side API testing tool.
</p>
<p>
API requests are initiated explicitly by the user and are sent directly from the user's device
to the target API endpoints using standard networking libraries (such as OkHttp).
Responses are received directly from the target API endpoints to the user's device.
</p>
<p>
At no point does Reqtor route API request or response data through developer-controlled servers.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
Reqtor does <strong>not store any API request data, response data, headers, payloads, or test results
on any cloud or backend infrastructure</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If the App allows saving request configurations, collections, or test definitions,
such data is stored locally on the user's device only.
</p>
<p>
Users can delete this data at any time from within the App. Uninstalling the App removes all
locally stored data.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Reqtor does not share user-provided API data with the developer or with any third party.
</p>
<p>
The App does not sell, rent, or trade any data.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
Reqtor does not use third-party services that access or process user-defined API request or
response data.
</p>
<p>
If analytics or crash reporting tools are used, they are limited to non-personal diagnostic
information and do not include API payloads, headers, or responses.
</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
Reqtor processes API requests exactly as configured by the user and relies on standard networking
protocols and the security measures implemented by the target APIs.
</p>
<p>
Users are responsible for the APIs they choose to call and for protecting any credentials,
tokens, or sensitive data they include in requests.
</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
Reqtor is intended for developers and testers and is not designed for use by children under
the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page
with an updated revision date.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
